# BidDog

BidDog is an open-source implementation of am-AMM ([Auction-Managed Automated Market Maker](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03367v1)), an add-on to decentralized exchanges that minimizes losses to arbitrage.

## Concepts

- **Block Index (blockIdx)**: A block number minus the block number of the contract deployment.
- **K**: The delay (in blocks) of a bid being submitted and the bidder becoming the manager of a pool. Set to 7200 by default.
- **`MIN_BID_MULTIPLIER`**: Specifies the minimum bid increment. Set to (1 + 10%) by default.
- **Manager**: The manager of a pool pays rent (in the bid token) each block for the privilege of receiving all swap fee revenue and setting the swap fee.
- **Bid**: Each bid in the auction specifies its rent (amount of bid tokens paid per block) and deposit (used to pay rent, >= rent \* K). The bid with the highest rent wins the auction.
- **Bid token**: The token used for bidding in the auction, usually the LP token of a DEX pool. Burnt over time by the manager to pay the rent to the remaining LPs.
- **Fee token**: Token collected as swap fee revenue. There are usually 2 fee tokens for each DEX pool.
- **Refund**: If you currently own the next bid and someone else makes a higher bid, your deposit is refunded to you, which you will need to claim.
- **Payload**: Custom payload attached to a bid, e.g. the desired swap fee. `bytes6` is used to allow implementers to customize how the payload is interpreted.

## Developer usage

Import `biddog/AmAmm.sol` and inherit from `AmAmm`, then implement the following functions based on the specifics of your DEX:

```solidity
/// @dev Returns whether the am-AMM is enabled for a given pool
function _amAmmEnabled(PoolId id) internal view virtual returns (bool);

/// @dev Validates a bid payload, e.g. ensure the swap fee is below a certain threshold
function _payloadIsValid(PoolId id, bytes6 payload) internal view virtual returns (bool);

/// @dev Burns bid tokens from address(this)
function _burnBidToken(PoolId id, uint256 amount) internal virtual;

/// @dev Transfers bid tokens from an address that's not address(this) to address(this)
function _pullBidToken(PoolId id, address from, uint256 amount) internal virtual;

/// @dev Transfers bid tokens from address(this) to an address that's not address(this)
function _pushBidToken(PoolId id, address to, uint256 amount) internal virtual;

/// @dev Transfers accrued fees from address(this)
function _transferFeeToken(Currency currency, address to, uint256 amount) internal virtual;
```

When you need to query the current manager & swap fee value, use:

```solidity
/// @dev Charges rent and updates the top and next bids for a given pool
function _updateAmAmmWrite(PoolId id) internal virtual returns (address manager, uint24 swapFee);

/// @dev View version of _updateAmAmmWrite()
function _updateAmAmm(PoolId id) internal view virtual returns (Bid memory topBid, Bid memory nextBid);
```

When your DEX needs to accrue swap fees to a manager, use:

```solidity
/// @dev Accrues swap fees to the manager
function _accrueFees(address manager, Currency currency, uint256 amount) internal virtual;
```

Optionally, you can override the constants used by am-AMM:

```solidity
function K(PoolId) internal view virtual returns (uint40) {
    return 7200;
}

function MIN_BID_MULTIPLIER(PoolId) internal view virtual returns (uint256) {
    return 1.1e18;
}

function MIN_RENT(PoolId) internal view virtual returns (uint128) {
    return 0;
}
```

## Manager usage

```solidity
/// @notice Places a bid to become the manager of a pool
/// @param id The pool id
/// @param manager The address of the manager
/// @param payload The payload specifying what parameters the manager wants, e.g. swap fee
/// @param rent The rent per block
/// @param deposit The deposit amount, must be a multiple of rent and cover rent for >=K blocks
function bid(PoolId id, address manager, bytes6 payload, uint128 rent, uint128 deposit) external;

/// @notice Adds deposit to the top bid. Only callable by topBids[id].manager.
/// @param id The pool id
/// @param amount The amount to deposit, must be a multiple of rent
function depositIntoTopBid(PoolId id, uint128 amount) external;

/// @notice Withdraws from the deposit of the top bid. Only callable by topBids[id].manager. Reverts if D_top / R_top < K.
/// @param id The pool id
/// @param amount The amount to withdraw, must be a multiple of rent and leave D_top / R_top >= K
/// @param recipient The address of the recipient
function withdrawFromTopBid(PoolId id, uint128 amount, address recipient) external;

/// @notice Adds deposit to the next bid. Only callable by nextBids[id].manager.
/// @param id The pool id
/// @param amount The amount to deposit, must be a multiple of rent
function depositIntoNextBid(PoolId id, uint128 amount) external;

/// @notice Withdraws from the deposit of the next bid. Only callable by nextBids[id].manager. Reverts if D_next / R_next < K.
/// @param id The pool id
/// @param amount The amount to withdraw, must be a multiple of rent and leave D_next / R_next >= K
/// @param recipient The address of the recipient
function withdrawFromNextBid(PoolId id, uint128 amount, address recipient) external;

/// @notice Cancels the next bid. Only callable by nextBids[id].manager. Reverts if D_top / R_top < K.
/// @param id The pool id
/// @param recipient The address of the recipient
/// @return refund The amount of refund claimed
function cancelNextBid(PoolId id, address recipient) external returns (uint256 refund);

/// @notice Claims the refundable deposit of a pool owed to msg.sender.
/// @param id The pool id
/// @param recipient The address of the manager
/// @return refund The amount of refund claimed
function claimRefund(PoolId id, address recipient) external returns (uint256 refund);

/// @notice Claims the accrued fees of msg.sender.
/// @param currency The currency of the fees
/// @param recipient The address of the recipient
/// @return fees The amount of fees claimed
function claimFees(Currency currency, address recipient) external returns (uint256 fees);

/// @notice Sets the payload of a pool. Only callable by the manager of either the top bid or the next bid.
/// @param id The pool id
/// @param payload The payload specifying e.g. the swap fee
/// @param topBid True if the top bid manager is setting the fee, false if the next bid manager is setting the fee
function setBidPayload(PoolId id, bytes6 payload, bool topBid) external;
```

## Design

BidDog was built as a state machine with the following state transitions:

```

```

## Modifications

Several modifications were made on the original am-AMM design to improve UX.

- When withdrawing from the deposit of the next bid, we enforce `D_next / R_next >= K` instead of `D_top / R_top + D_next / R_next >= K` to ensure that the deposit of a bid cannot go below `R * K` before the bid becomes active.
- After the top bid's deposit depletes we make sure that the next bid has existed for at least `K` blocks before making it active.

## Known issues

- `blockIdx` is a `uint48`, and when it overflows the `currentBlockIdx >= nextBidStartBlockIdx` checks will have undefined behavior. Even with a block time of 10ms it would take ~89 thousand years for the overflow to occur, so it's unlikely to be a problem in practice.
